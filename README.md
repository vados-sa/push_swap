# push_swap

## 📝 Overview  
push_swap is a project that challenges us to sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations on two stacks (`a` and `b`). The goal is to achieve the correct order with the fewest moves possible.  

For this project, I implemented the **Turk Algorithm**, created by fellow 42 student **[Ayogun](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97)**.  

## 🔧 Key Concepts Learned  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing an efficient stack-based sorting method.
- **Stack Manipulation**: Using `push`, `swap`, `rotate`, and `reverse rotate` operations.  
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Reducing moves for efficiency.  
- **Time Complexity Awareness**: Finding the best trade-off between execution speed and move count.
